# Task definition

In this project, it is required to implement a simple analogue of the [diff utility] (https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff), 
calculating the difference between two text files as a sequence of lines inserted and deleted,
allowing to receive the second from the first file. It is not required to take into account changes within the lines.

The solution can be based on the algorithm [Longest Common Subsequence Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problem),
but this is optional. It is required to independently develop and describe a custom
program interface, input and output data formats, organize testing, make sure
that the program works with large enough files, provide sets of files for verification
implementation correctness.
